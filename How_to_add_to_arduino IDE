This will be a guide to add to the arduino IDE
    Upload Arduino Code to Arduino Nano:
        Connect your Arduino Nano to your computer using a USB cable.
        Open the Arduino IDE and copy the modified Arduino code into a new sketch.
        Make sure to select the correct board and port for your Arduino Nano in the Arduino IDE.
        Click the "Upload" button to upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

    Upload ESP32 Code to ESP32:
        Connect your ESP32 development board to your computer using a USB cable.
        Set up your ESP32 development environment (e.g., using the Arduino IDE or another suitable IDE).
        Copy the provided ESP32 code into a new sketch.
        Upload the code to the ESP32 development board.

    Hardware Connection:
        Ensure that the Bluetooth module is connected to both the Arduino Nano and the ESP32.
        Connect the TX pin of the Bluetooth module to the RX pin of the Arduino Nano, and connect the RX pin of the Bluetooth module to the TX pin of the Arduino Nano.
        Connect the TX pin of the Bluetooth module to the RX pin of the ESP32, and connect the RX pin of the Bluetooth module to the TX pin of the ESP32.
        Make sure all devices share a common ground.

    Power Supply:
        Power the Arduino Nano and the ESP32 development board separately using appropriate power sources (e.g., USB power, batteries, etc.).
        Ensure that the Bluetooth module is powered and operational.

    Testing:
        Once both devices are powered and running their respective codes, they should establish a Bluetooth connection.
        You can verify the communication by sending data from the Arduino Nano's serial monitor to the ESP32 and vice versa.
        Monitor the serial outputs of both devices to ensure that they are communicating as expected.
