I have made some inital code it is not finished and fine tuned with the unique ids of the arudinio
this code will be based on a xbox controller for their library as seen in the XboxCode file.
The Bluetooth will be able to connect to other controllers but will need to be modified.

Install dependencies


Install ESP-IDF
Install the ESP32 toolchain. Use version 4.4 or 5.1. Might work on newer / older
ones, but not tested.

Integrate BTstack into ESP32

cd ${BLUEPAD32}/external/btstack/port/esp32
# This will install BTstack as a component inside Bluepad32 source code (recommended).
# Remove "IDF_PATH=../../../../src" if you want it installed in the ESP-IDF folder
IDF_PATH=../../../../src ./integrate_btstack.py

Compile Bluepad32

# Possible options: esp32, esp32-s3 or esp32-c3
idf.py set-target esp32
And compile it:

idf.py build

Flash it

idf.py flash monitor
